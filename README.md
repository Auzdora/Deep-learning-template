### 1. Introduction
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
Hi, there. This project's name is deep learning template code, 
which means it provides a model or a template or framework, if
you wanna call it, for deep learning experiments or deep learning
project. The purpose of this project is to simplify the process of
deep learning, __it aims at covering all of necessary steps during
an experiment__. It requires no extra movements, all you need to do
is just __focus on neural network's frame and tune the parameters to
get the best result__.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
Next, diagram part introduces the whole framework for your guys
to understand how this project been built.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
Module and function part describes every directory's function and
utility. So you can add more based on these.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
How to use part demonstrates how you can implement this during
a project.
